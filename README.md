Machine Learning Pipelines for Computer Vision in Construction

pipeline.py and utils.py are the two key Python scripts that will be utilised for Azure later on. 

interactive.py is the Python script that demonstrates how each TFX component works (expanded version of pipeline.py).

utils.py file is used by pipeline.py and interactive.py to invoke functions.

TBC: Once all of the pipeline codes in pipeline.py are correctly configured, they will not be altered. The only codes that will be altered based on Group 2's codes are those in utils.py, as mentioned in the comments within the file. 

NOTE: These scripts are not yet completely commented.

Pipeline version:
* TensorFlow version: 2.7.0
* TFX version: 1.5.0
